		<h4>One kiss is all it takes<br>
			Fallin' in love with me<br>
			Possibilities<br>
			I look like all you need<br>
			<br>
			Let me take the night, I love real easy<br>
			And I know that you'll still wanna see me<br>
			On the Sunday morning, music real loud<br>
			Let me love you while the moon is still out<br>
			<br>
			Something in you<br>
			Lit up heaven in me<br>
			The feeling won't let me sleep<br>
			'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel<br>
			<br>
			One kiss is all it takes<br>
			Fallin' in love with me<br>
			Possibilities<br>
			I look like all you need<br>
			<br>
			One kiss is all it takes<br>
			Fallin' in love with me<br>
			Possibilities<br>
			I look like all you need<br>

			Darling<br>

			One<br>
			Darling<br>
			<br>
			I just want to feel your skin on mine<br>
			Feel your eyes do the exploring<br>
			Passion in the message when you smile<br>
			Take my time<br>
			<br>
			It's something in you<br>
			Lit up heaven in me<br>
			The feeling won't let me sleep<br>
			'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel<br>
			<br>
			One kiss is all it takes<br>
			Fallin' in love with me<br>

			See wonderland in your eyes<br>
			Might need your company tonight<br>
			<br>
			Something in you<br>
			Lit up heaven in me<br>
			The feeling won't let me sleep<br>
			'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel<br>
